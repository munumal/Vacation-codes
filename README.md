# Expense Tracker
When you run the main.py script:

The user is asked to input expense details (month, category, description, amount).

These details are stored in the expenses dictionary.

The user can keep adding expenses until they decide to stop.

All expenses are then printed out in a user-friendly format.

The user can view the total expenses and category-wise expenses for any specific month.
